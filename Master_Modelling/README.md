# R course and Reproducible research with R markdown

This is the material corresponding to the lectures for the classes given on Data Visualization and Modelling course from Master in Modelling for Science and Engineering, UAB. They are prepared to learn R, tidyverse and create reproducible documents using Markdown.

# List of Materials

- Description: A 8-hours R and Mardown course (6-hours tidyverse)
- Author: [Juan R Gonzalez](https://github.com/isglobal-brge/) 
- Content: Part I: R course; Part II: Reproducible research; Part III: tidyverse


## R course

- The folder **R_course** contains the slides describing how to use Rstudio as well as an introduction to R. There is another pdf file summarizing the main feaures of R. The slides are organized by blocks. After each block several tasks are proposed. These tasks consist on simple problems that will be used to assess whether the student has understood the R code previously explained. These tasks have to be delivered (see 'Homework and deliveries' section). 

## Reproducible Research

- The folder **Reproducible_research** contains a pdf that describes how to combine R code in a html or pdf file. It uses _knitr_ that is also introduced.

### tidyverse

- The folder **tidyverse** contains the slides and R code to perform data wrangling, data transformation and data visualization using tidyverse. It also contains slides describing how to perform genomic data visualization using Gviz and bigviz. 

# Homework and deliveries

- **TASK 1:** The slides located in **R_course** folder have some exercises that must be delivered. The student has to write an script with the R code used to address each question. It is not necessary to copy the statement, just use # to comment the number of the question. 

- **TASK 2:** The folder **Exercise_markdown** contains a pdf describing the final exercise to be delivered. 

Answers of both exercises (.R file for the first task and the pdf generated from the .Rmd file, respectively) must be sent to \texttt{juanr.gonzalez@isglobal.org} before:

- **TASK 1:** 1st October 12:00pm
- **TASK 2:** 8th October 12:00pm
